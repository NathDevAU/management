These projects go by many names, but are commonly known as starter kits or projects.  Starter kits can act as code samples, and may contain a version of an SDK, but provide a complete application that reflects common integrations with an API.  As with samples and SDKs, start kits will speed up integrations, providing developers with the path of least resistance from registration to active API integration.</p>",
