And the opportunity to extend beyond mobile to IPTV, web-based apps, multi-screen, enterprise services etc., offers an even greater opportunity to grow revenue and attract and retain subscribers.\nHowever, the complexity of today's communication and content industries present major obstacles to the creation of new applications. Developers are faced with thousands of devices, hundreds of service providers with varying technical requirements and a rapidly growing community of app stores. In this highly fragmented environment, developers are forced to make tough choices that limit which devices an application can run on, which functions can be provided and which service providers will be targeted.\nUltimately this reduces the market reach and revenue potential that applications can generate for developers, as well as service providers and enterprises, while at the same time seriously limiting choice and flexibility for consumers everywhere.\nService providers, enterprises and application developers alike have an immediate opportunity to reverse the tired, traditional model; leveraging the network as the platform to incite unforeseen levels of collaboration, openness and innovation in our industry.\nThe Open API Platform offers unique value to both service providers and enterprises interested in innovating on existing assets and establishing a deeper relationship with the developer community.\nFrom Enterprises to Service Providers\nThe Open API Platform allows service providers to expand their position in the value chain and move beyond the role of \"connection provider.\" Enterprises gain insight into how to best leverage their existing assets and expose them to developer communities in order to stimulate innovation and expand the reach of their brand.\nWith the Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform, service providers and enterprises gain a simple framework for exposing their key assets and managing their own developer communities. The Open API Platform enables service providers and enterprises to:\n\nExpose their APIs in the form of REST APIs to make them more easily and widely used by the developer community\nCreate their own developer programs or supplement their existing ecosystem of developers, content providers and third-party API providers\nCollaborate with developers to deliver services that attract and retain subscribers\nEarn additional revenue from existing assets. For service providers, these could be network assets such as context and location information, QoS, device and subscriber information, and more. For enterprises, this could be a variety of assets based on the specific industry being served. In retail for example, an extensive product catalog and library might serve as an asset to leverage.\n\nFor Developers\nThe Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform provides tools that allow developers to collaborate, build, test and distribute new applications for service provider networks. It provides open access to network-based APIs, third party APIs and Alcatel-Lucent APIs (like the new Multi-screen Foundation APIs) to help stimulate the development of new applications that take full advantage of what the network can offer.\nFurthermore, our platform provides the critical business tools developers need to manage applications throughout their lifecycle. Our approach helps developers expand the audience for their applications &mdash; reaching more service providers, more end users and more devices, with less time, effort and cost.\nExpanding the Ecosystem\nIn June 2010, Alcatel-Lucent acquired ProgrammableWeb, the technology industry's universal source for Web APIs used by application developers to build web, mobile, and other connected applications that serve consumers and the workplace. One month later, in July of 2010, Alcatel-Lucent also acquired OpenPlug, a mobile software and development tools provider. The acquisition of OpenPlug allowed Alcatel-Lucent to deepen its tole in the applications space by delivering, as part of an integrated suite of developer tools, a platform where application developers can write an application once, which will then be translated to run on any of the five major mobile operating systems.\nAlcatel-Lucent's aquisition of these companies helps bring together an ecosystem of service providers, enterprises, and developers to drive the creation of unique applications today and in the new world of broadband mobile through LTE.","website":"http:\/\/openapiservice.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Alcatel_Lucent","github":"","blog":"http:\/\/www2.alcatel-lucent.com\/blogs\/corporate\/","blogrss":"","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/alcatel-lucent-logo.jpg","screenshot":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/Alcatel-Lucent-Screenshot.png","tags":"API Management,Financial,Retail,Service provider,Telco"},{"id":"9","name":"Mashape","summary":"Mashape provides tools that enable developers to quickly deliver and consume APIs and offers a marketplace for listing APIs. &nbsp;Mashape provides tools for testing your API, code for generation of custom errors, components for user management and standardized API code language libraries in multiple languages. &nbsp;Once your API is ready for prime time Mashape provides a marketplace for listing ","details":"Mashape provides tools that enable developers to quickly deliver and consume APIs and offers a marketplace for listing APIs. &nbsp;Mashape provides tools for testing your API, code for generation of custom errors, components for user management and standardized API code language libraries in multiple languages. &nbsp;Once your API is ready for prime time Mashape provides a marketplace for listing your API, letting developers to easily discover and begin hacking with your API, in a social API community environment.","website":"http:\/\/www.mashape.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mashape","github":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mashape","blog":"http:\/\/blog.mashape.com\/","blogrss":"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/MashapesVoice","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/mashape-logo.png","screenshot":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/Mashape-Screenshot.png","tags":"API Directory,API Discovery,API Management"},{"id":"1","name":"Mashery","summary":"Mashery&nbsp;is an API management service provider that offers an API as a Software as a Service (SaaS).
