<p>The area of API management service providers is something I've been tracking on since I started <a href="http://apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>. I did a <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/" target="_blank">round-up of API service providers in 2011</a>, and again covered the expanding world of <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/" target="_blank">API service providers in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>As the definition of what is API service provider expands, I try to break off into their own projects as I've done with API Aggregation, API Reciprocity, Backend as a Service (BaaS) and Real-Time.  For now "API Management", is the catch all project category for any API related online service that I haven't broken off, and will remain the home for the classic definition of what is API service provider like 3Scale and APIphany.</p>
<p>I have API management providers broken into about 9 separate categories, which I will be expanding on as new ones emerge or are discovered.</p>
