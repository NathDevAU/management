<p>We’re going to be attending and talking at the API Strategy and Practice conference in Chicago this week, so feel free to get in touch and come and see us.The topic of our presentation will be – performance, what the logs don’t tell you? And, not to give anything away, this will focus on the problem that averages or server performance logs will tend to hide things. Firstly, averages can easily fool you into thinking that all is well with your performance, caching in particular can make the actual numbers look significantly better than they actually are, or hide issues on the outside like a poorly performing load balancer.Secondly, the logs themselves might be measuring the wrong things.</p>
