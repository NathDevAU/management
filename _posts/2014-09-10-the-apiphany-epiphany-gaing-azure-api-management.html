<p>Back in October, we announced the acquisition of apiphany; a recent entrant to the API management space based in Washington-DC.I’m excited to announce that today, Azure API Management leaves Preview and goes GA, with a 99.9% SLA.Before the acquisition, I found myself explaining API Management to many colleagues and I developed a repertoire of scenarios to quickly explain the value proposition of this upcoming capability; I saw a few eureka moments,  which I call the apiphany epiphany.All had a common theme: scaling and accelerating partnerships.</p>
