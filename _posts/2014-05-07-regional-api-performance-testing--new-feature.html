<p>This is one we’ve been asked for a lot, and it’s available now for Pro and higher level accounts. We’ve enabled a variety of regional test centers for running ongoing tests against the API. The aim is to give you a better idea of the performance of the API when your apps are running in different locations and also to see what impact data center access can have on your apps and services.We’re currently supporting the following regions and expect to add more targeted options later:
We’ve been running this for a week or so now and gathering data on some common APIs. The first interesting result for us, is showing the difference in performance between the Facebook data centers on the East and West Coast.</p>
