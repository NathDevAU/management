<p>At Gnip, our customers’ experience is that social data has been “business-critical” for a while.But Susan Etlinger’s point is worth reiterating.While businesses have spent the last few years trying to figure out the “what” and the “why” of social data, they are increasingly focusing on “where” their data comes from.And the most sophisticated businesses know that scraped data is fundamentally different from a rate-limited public API, which is different than a full firehose.The WordPress platform now represents an amazing 19% of the web.</p>
