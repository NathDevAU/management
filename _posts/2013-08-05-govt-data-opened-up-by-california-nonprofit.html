<p>California Common Sense (CACS), the non-partisan, non-profit dedicated to opening government data to the public, recently launched a Socrata-powered online transparency portal for its users.The portal offers citizens the unique opportunity to research and analyze the issues that matter to them, in an easily navigable format.The site is free to use, and provides users access to large datasets that can be completely customized and visualized for a variety of uses.Of the initial information included in the portal, the most accessed are datasets on funding for K – 12 students, national Medicaid spending, and California city and state employee salaries.The information can be filtered and sorted by date, type, service category, and more.</p>
