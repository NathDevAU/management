<p>Steve Sokol
Product Lead - Respoke
Over the years I’ve been part of several of startups and I love the energy, excitement and sense of risk that comes with launching into uncharted waters.When the Digium leadership team decided that our best approach to finding a business model that capitalized on WebRTC and web communications was to spin up a startup, I was thrilled.For the past two years I’ve been working as a virtual co-founder in the organization that we now call Respoke.Being part of a virtual startup inside of Digium has been quite a ride.It’s not quite the same as your typical startup, but it’s also not business as usual.</p>
