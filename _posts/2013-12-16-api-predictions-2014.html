<p>2013 has been an impressive year for API technology both in terms adoption, technology and investment.The number of APIs listed in the ProgrammableWeb directory crossed 10,000 for the first time, there were investments and acquisitions, as well as multiple new conferences on APIs sprang up during the year including our own API Strategy and Practice Co-organised with API Evangelist.There were also new initiatives like API Commons that try to address some of the longer-term industry challenges.At 3scale the number of live customer APIs we power has already more than doubled over the year and so has API traffic.So after a great 2013, we asked ourselves what next year might have in store â€“ here are our API Predictions 2014!</p>
