{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m excited to announce the newest release of the WSO2 API Manager as it introduces two industry firsts.Featuring full native multi-tenancy, The WSO2 API Manager is: 
 The first API management product that can run on servers, in a private cloud, public cloud or hybrid cloud environment—all from the same software.The first API management product that enables federated access to APIs across multiple entities, enabling new models for organizations to collaborate and monetize APIs.The 100% open source WSO2 API Manager offers an API Store, for IT organizations to set up their own Apple or Google Marketplace-like store where developers can easily subscribe to and consume APIs.And also provides API publishers with complete API lifecycle governance—from creating to publishing, deprecating and retiring APIs—as well as analytics and metrics to support decision-making and enforce service-level agreement (SLA) policies.</p>
