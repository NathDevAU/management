<p>Azure Site Recovery (ASR) allows Microsoft Azure to be used as a disaster recovery site for your virtual machines.You can read up on the blog from Brad Anderson about announcement of preview of disaster recovery to Azure using Azure Site Recovery to know more about ASR.When an administrator is thinking about adding disaster recovery capabilities to an application, they need to think through and plan the networking infrastructure so that the application is accessible by users after failover with minimal downtime.This post explains how to setup the required networking infrastructure with the help of an example.We will start with describing the application and then we will look how to setup networking on-premises and on Azure and then concluding with how to do a test failover and a planned failover.</p>
