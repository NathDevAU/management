<p>The Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a service that allows you to send audio, images, and other static files faster and more reliably to customers across the globe.It does this by utilizing a worldwide network of servers that are capable of serving content from the nearest node relevant to each user (an updated list of all current node location can be found here).This can dramatically increase speed and availability, resulting in a significant improvement to user experience.CDNs are commonly used to serve images and scripts for websites, and now, Azure Websites supports direct integration with CDN.This blog post will walk you through setting up a basic website, integrating CDN support, and then using Developer Tools to see our CDN in action.</p>
