<p>We are happy to announce that Azure Cloud Services now support reverse DNS records for all PaaS and IaaS Cloud Services.This support is backwards compatible with all existing Cloud Services, and is being offered at no additional cost.This feature is currently supported in the Service Management API, and through PowerShell.What are reverse DNS records?Reverse DNS records are used in a variety of situations to weakly authenticate the caller.</p>
