<p>I just added four new API to my API stack series.I&rsquo;m considering breaking the API Stack series into a separate feed, they kind of clutter the main feed.Anyways, the four new APIs are from 3Scale:

Service Management API
Account Management API
Analytics API
Billing API

These four APIs offer the essential building blocks to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content and services via a web API.&nbsp;3Scale has had their Service Management API for a while, but recently added the account, analytics and billing services, making a complete set of API management APIs.3Scale already has two significant differentiors from other API managerment service providers:

Proxy-Less - 3Scale is different than the other service providers in that they dont proxy your APIs.</p>
