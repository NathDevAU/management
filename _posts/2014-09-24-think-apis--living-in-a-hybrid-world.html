<p>No discussion about APIs is complete without considering how APIs relate to Cloud.The fourth API entry point, “Living in a Hybrid World”, is focused on using APIs as the uniform consumption model across a hybrid ecosystem of on-premise, private cloud and public cloud environments.The business mantra is “Freedom of choice”.Freedom to choose how to source any function or data and freedom to deploy solutions to any desired form factor.The following characteristics drive the need for an API centric approach to integration:
- A disconnected enterprise is not competitive, hence Cloud equals hybrid and integration needs to be managed at scale
- Cloud is about capabilities (business and IT), not location, hence any ubiquitous consumption model needs to be location independent
- In a “system of systems” world there is no traditional network perimeter to enforce, hence interactions need to be controlled at the application level
If to a consumer everything is a (remote-able) API, then the consumer need not know anything about where and how that API is hosted.</p>
