<p>The  continuing transformation of the IT industry around the externalization of  service components constitutes an exercise in abstraction.  The transformation assumes that any IT  application can be recursively decomposed into constituent services.  An application that has been re-architected  or engineered this way is known as a composite  application.As with  any abstraction exercise, the devil is in the details.  When a particular capability is to be  replaced with a service, just as good is not sufficient to trigger change; it  needs to be much better to make the change justifiable from a business  perspective, anywhere from 3X to 10X to overcome the change hysteresis or the  incumbent alternative stays.</p>
