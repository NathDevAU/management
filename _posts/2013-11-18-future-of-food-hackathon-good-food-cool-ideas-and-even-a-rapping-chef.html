<p>Last weekend we had a blast at the Future of Food Hackaton.It was great to see that many people with such different backgrounds (tech, nutrition, restauration, design) working together in some really cool ideas on how to become more conscious of what you eat, improve your healthy eating habits, save time on doing your grocery shopping, or make it easier to choose where to eat, amongst many others!Projects and Winners
 There were a total of 20 projects which were built over the weekend, and there were all sorts of types of projects.We liked ‘Team Cook‘ and app that helps you cook hands free, ‘Good World Chef‘, which goal is to make it easier to cook healthier and sustainable meals for your family with a really nice and simple interface, and ‘ThoughtFull‘, a tool to allow people to subscribe to the food products and services that you like, just to mention some of them.The winner was ‘FoodForest‘, a really cool project to form local communities and contribute resources in growing and sharing food.</p>
