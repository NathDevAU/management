<p>What does it really mean, to “think APIs”?Some people simply point to the API value chain, but is that all there is to it?Is that what the excitement is all about?Personally I feel that such an answer is too simplistic.As earlier discussed there are decisions to be made regarding the balance between enterprise and opportunistic APIs.</p>
