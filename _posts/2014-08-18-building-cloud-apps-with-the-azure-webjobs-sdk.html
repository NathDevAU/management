<p>As noted in a recent post, MS Press has published an e-book based on Scott Guthrieâ€™s presentation, Building Cloud Apps With Windows Azure.The book consistently features Azure Websites as the default choice for hosting web applications, with one exception where it switches to Cloud Services.In the queue-centric work pattern chapter, the book uses a Worker Role to handle backend processing for the Fix It sample application.Scott made that choice when he was developing his presentation because at the time there was no way to host a backend process in Azure Websites.Since then, Azure WebJobs was introduced.</p>
