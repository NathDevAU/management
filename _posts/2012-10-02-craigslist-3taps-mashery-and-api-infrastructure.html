<p>If youâ€™ve followed the legal dispute between Craigslist and first Padmapper, then 3taps over re-use of their data.you may know that things have taken an even deeper twist.Craigslist has now served a Cease &amp; Desist to Mashery, 3taps API Management service provider.Mashery subsequently dropped support for 3taps.Whether Mashery did the right thing or not is difficult to judge, but certainly legal action like this puts a company in a very difficult position.</p>
