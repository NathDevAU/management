<p>Have you launched your API and are you having a hard time understanding why it’s not being used as much as you anticipated?You’ve followed all the best practices, used all the latest technologies and have made sure it is always up and running.For some reason developers are not using your API, and its usage is not increasing over time.Perhaps you forgot about the most important thing about your API: developers!Without developers that use your API and build new apps all the effort that you’ve put into it is meaningless.</p>
