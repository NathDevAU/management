<p>Weve made several performance and stability enhancements to our API recently.Because of the significance of the changes and also to keep our API consistent, were changing the default base URL to /v3.No need to change your endpoints.All existing API methods remain backward compatible and keep the same request/response format.However, there will be some behavioral changes in a few of them.</p>
