<p>This year’s Gluecon as always was a mix ideas and memes (a great event as always!).Reflecting on the talks and conversations on the flight back, there seemed to be one to us which stood our more than any other, which was nicely captured by Michael Rose‘s Tweet:  
 “We’re all distributed systems people now.” #gluecon @argv0

 In fact, we always were, but conveniently forget that fact most of the time.Specifically, APIs, Cloud deployments, SAAS and “remote access to everything” make building systems incredibly hard because they are distributed – across organisations.</p>
