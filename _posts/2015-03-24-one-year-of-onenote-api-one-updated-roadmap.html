<p>Hello fellow OneNote API travelers.Gareth here, wearing a paper hat and eating a slice of birthday cake.I cant quite believe its been a whole year since my colleague Steven posted our first entry on this blog for the OneNote API launch.What a year its been â€“ we added an amazing set of partners, a host of updated features, samples, and integrations.A whole bunch of conferences where its been our privilege to meet many, many customers and get great feedback and ideas.</p>
