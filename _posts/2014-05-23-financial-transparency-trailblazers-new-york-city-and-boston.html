<p>After our last financial transparency webinar with Montgomery County, Maryland, we received quite a few comments from viewers.While most found it helpful to see a demo of Socrataâ€™s Open Budget app, many also wanted to know more about the process of making finances transparent to the public.How does the process work?How do city/county leaders decide what data to publish?What is the citizen response to more open finances?</p>
