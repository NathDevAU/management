<p>Hello and welcome to the API Innovation Corner – a new video series powered by CA Technologies and the API Academy, aimed at helping you use existing and emerging API technologies to solve technical challenges associated with the business and IT goals of today’s open enterprise.During this series, we will be discussing how the API is becoming the fundamental platform that will empower enterprises to capitalize on new digital trends in the application economy – how APIs are helping companies retain customers, open up new routes to market and meet their employee productivity goals. 
The API Innovation Corner is also where we will tie business objectives to solutions and discuss how CA API Management delivers innovative capabilities that can assist you with API projects. And that leads us to the first video in the series, featuring Scott Morrison, Distinguished Engineer within CA’s API Management business unit
