<p>Providing well-written documentation helps people understand, make use of, and contribute back to your project, but its only half of the documentation equation.The underlying system used to serve documentation can make life easier for the people writing it—whether thats just you or the team you work with.The hardest part about documentation should be deciding which words to use, not configuring tools or figuring out how to deploy updates.Members  of the GitHub Documentation Team come from backgrounds where crude XML-based authoring tools and complicated CMSs are the norm.We didnt want to use those tools here so weve spent a good deal of time configuring our own documentation workflow and set-up.</p>
