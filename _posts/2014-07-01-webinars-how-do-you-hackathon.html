<p>Following on the heels of the National Day of Civic Hacking, we want to ask you a question: How do YOU hackathon?Whether you are hacking for change, for social justice, or to improve the lives of the people in your community, there are many ways to make your next hackathon even more successful.  
To help you plan, organize, brand, promote, and implement your next hackathon, we are hosting a series of webinars with hackathon experts.In the month of July, you have two opportunities to learn from some of the best and brightest civic hackathon organizers.  
First, on July 16th, join us as we sit down with Brian Gryth and Aaron Templer of GoCode Colorado, the first statewide event of its kind.</p>
