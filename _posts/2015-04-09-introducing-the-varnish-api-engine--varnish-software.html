<p>Over the last couple of years we’ve seen an explosion in the use of HTTP-based APIs.We’ve seen them go from being a rather slow and useless but interesting technology fifteen years ago to todays current, high performance RESTful interfaces that powers much of the web and most of the app-space.Varnish Cache has been used for HTTP-based APIs since its inception.The combination of caching, high performance and the flexibility brought by VCL makes it an ideal proxy for APIs.We’ve seen people doing rather complex protocol negotiations in VCL to do interesting things like matching frontend and backend protocols.</p>
