<p>When Trulia co-founder Pete Flint searched for a home to buy, he felt frustrated by how hard it was to gather all of the information he needed to make his decision.Fortunately, he channeled his frustration into a new business opportunity – give prospective homebuyers more information about not just the homes they’re considering, but the neighborhoods their buying into.Flint teamed up with Stanford Graduate School of Business classmate Sami Inkinen to create Trulia (NYSE: TRLA), a website with home data plus more for cities across the U.S.The key additional information that Trulia offers beyond square footage and heating details is largely public data but can be difficult to find.</p>
