<p>Multi-purpose platform as a service (PaaS) supports not only all major integration use cases, but also master data management and API management.Dell Boomi on March 18 added some key functionality to its cloud integration platform: full API (application programming interface) lifecycle management.This addition boosts Boomi into a multi-purpose platform as a service (PaaS) that supports not only all major integration use cases, but also master data management and API management.Master data management keeps track of every bit of data in its lifecycle: how it was used or not used, whether it was stored or archived, or whether it was deleted.It comprises the processes, governance, policies, standards and tools that define and manage the critical data of an organization to provide a single point of reference for all users.</p>
