<p>Today at Box Dev, we unveiled Box Developer Edition, a fundamentally new way to build on the Box platform that allows you to seamlessly bring the full power of Box into your application.Heres how it works:
Box Developer Edition gives you:
An independent, developer-owned Box instance — with full Box enterprise functionality — dedicated to your app.A new user and authentication model that makes it incredibly easy to create new Box users for your application.You own the users, the content, and the authentication and can bring a seamless user experience tailored to your customers.All of Boxs critical enterprise-grade functionality that more than half the Fortune 500 already trust and that you need to build (and sell) transformative software for businesses.</p>
