<p>The well-cemented conventional wisdom today is that the bloated and bureaucratic public sector does little to contribute in a meaningful way to American communities.Indeed, 64 percent of those surveyed by the American Enterprise Institute last year said that government has a negative impact on people’s lives.That’s up from 45 percent a decade ago.And, if we’re talking about “brand identity,” government is viewed by many as the equivalent of an ATM that takes in taxes and delivers services in return.As a number of commentators have written: the Federal government is basically an insurance company with an army.</p>
