<p>StrikeIrons Sales Tax Rate APIs are a few of the many solutions we make available on our IronCloud platform for easy integration and consumption by third party commerce products.These are XML-based APIs, enabling shipping addresses (or any address) to be sent over the Internet with a call to the Cloud-based service.The appropriate sales tax is then calculated for various jurisdictions and returned to the calling application - all occurring in milliseconds!An open XML API approach enables the service to be integrated into e-commerce Web sites, shopping cart applications, mobile commerce applications, PayPal, Stripe, Amazon FPS, Google Checkout, Verisign, and any other e-commerce scenario where a SOAP or REST XML call can be made (which is just about everything!).</p>
