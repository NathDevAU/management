<p>04 Mar 2015   
I am adding four new building blocks, to my list of suggested building blocks that API providers should consider when crafting their API management strategy.These four building blocks, are based upon several things I’ve seen in the space, and how some current deficiencies I’ve identified that could slow things, and hold us back.These new building blocks are all about API providers practicing what they preach, and making the account for API consumers, and developers, programmatic through an API management API.As I was profiling the Maijet API as part of my email API research, I noticed they had an API for their developer accounts, and with the growth in the number of APIs being consumed, the need for account automation is only going to incease, something that is only getting even more critical when you think about the API service composition overhead needed to support the containerization and micro-services movement.To help stimulate this area, and encourage API providers to automate their API accounts, I’m adding these four separate APIs building blocks, providing an overall blueprint for how API providers can launch a developer account API for their own API.</p>
