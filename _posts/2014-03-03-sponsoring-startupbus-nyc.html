<p>After rolling out of bed around 3:30 AM everyone stumbled sleepily to Spotify Head Quarters in New York City before the bus left at 4:45AM SHARP.Of course the sleepiness could not last too long – 10 minutes after scrambling to find a good seat (preferably one at a table) the fun began with the rally of our crazy conductors Alice Ng and Nate Cooper.Everyone introduced themselves, gave their backgrounds and a pitch (whether they had one or not).All the Busprenuers have interesting and diverse backgrounds which makes for entertaining and motivating company.Some people came with an idea, some people made up ideas on the spot, and one person even came with a full blown startup pitch including a pamphlet.</p>
