<p>To ensure you receive timely notification of issues, outages and status of the Genability API and web applications, we are instituting a new support notification process.We promise you the following: 1.Outage Notifications We have internal and external monitoring services which automatically notify our engineering team of issues.If the API or app servers experience an outage, a significant slowdown, or some other issue, we will send a notification email to you via Zendesk.We will tell you exactly which services are, and are not, affected.</p>
