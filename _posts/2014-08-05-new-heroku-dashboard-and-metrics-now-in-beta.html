<p>At Heroku, weâ€™re focused on delivering thoughtfully designed systems to improve developer productivity and experience.We firmly believe that improving the development and operations experience helps developers to build and run better apps.This improvement allows developers to focus more on functionality, and businesses to focus more on the value of their applications.Today we are pleased to announce two new features, both in public beta, that support this mission: a new Heroku Dashboard and Heroku Metrics.These new systems bring developers powerful new clarity and simplicity around application management, execution, and optimization.</p>
