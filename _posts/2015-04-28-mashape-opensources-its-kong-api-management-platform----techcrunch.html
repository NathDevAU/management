<p>Mashape, the increasingly popular management platform and marketplace for APIs, today open-sourced one of the core technologies that power its service.The platform, called Kong, allows Mashape to power the API requests of the more than 140,000 developers who currently use its service.The company describes Kong as a “drop-in replacement for expensive proprietary API management systems.”
 As Mashape CEO and co-founder Augusto Marietti told me earlier this month, the idea behind Kong is to give developers a centralized management layer for microservices and APIs.Kong gives developers a centralized dispatcher they can rely on to talk to the microservices that power their applications and APIs.</p>
