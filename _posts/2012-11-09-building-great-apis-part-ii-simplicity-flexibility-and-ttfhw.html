<p>Last week’s Building Great APIs post covered two of John Musser and Adam Duvander’s 5 Key Elements of great APIs: providing value and having a business model.In this post we’ll tackle the next topic: Make it simple, flexible and easily adopted.The three statements seem obvious until you begin to unpick what they mean – and they might even seem contradictory.Making an API simple seems like a noble goal but it can easily be thwarted by complex edge use cases, existing legacy code and a tendency on the part of some API designers to expose underlying data models in raw form.Flexibility often breeds complexity as the API becomes overloaded to meet many use cases.</p>
