<p>I’ve found myself thinking quite a bit about collaborative documents and wikis recently.I wrote a bit a few months ago about my new love for GitHub and while I’d heard of people throwing out the idea of collaborative writing using GitHub I hadn’t seen that actually done too well (or much at all really) in practice.After all, at it’s core, GitHub is a versioning system with a focus on software development with a bit of project management/bug tracking thrown in.Could one shoehorn the idea of collaborative writing into the platform?Sure.</p>
