<p>A CDO’s mission is to develop a digital vision that aligns with business goals and strategy, and drives change through digital initiatives and deliverables that improves a company’s competitive position.To do this, there’s a fair amount of negotiating among teams to gain support for the digital transformation that will drive business success.As the CDO maneuvers the organization, setting vision and driving cultural change, digital execution will require more than collaboration.It also will require the right technology to support the digital initiatives discussed in my last blog, “The rise of the chief digital officer.” The application programming interface (API) will provide the foundational platform to bridge enterprise data with the app.</p>
