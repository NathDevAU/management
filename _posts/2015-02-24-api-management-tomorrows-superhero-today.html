<p>I recently noticed an old trade show giveaway on a colleague’s desk – a cardboard cutout figure called API Defender (pictured above), which was used to promote CA’s API Management products.API Defender was fun and a bit retro, like something you’d cut off the back of a cereal box as a kid.But he got me thinking about the hidden power of API Management – something you don’t normally see but which many rely on to keep valuable information assets safe.Actually, most superheroes – in the movies, at least – are retro.Think of how the Christopher Reeve-era Superman films harked back to old adventure serials.</p>
