<p>Several months ago I wrote a post called Where, oh where, does the API key go?  I encouraged API providers to allow consumers to put the API Key in the Authorization header to help avoid accidental disclosure of keys via things like web server logs.  I recently bumped into a way that anyone can harvest hundreds of API keys from many different web sites, including ones that charge significant amounts of money for access.The API Keys I discovered are in HttpArchive.  HttpArchive is a project started by Steve Souders as a tool to help make the web faster.</p>
