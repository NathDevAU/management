<p>High speed encoding has been a top customer ask for Azure Media Services and that ask has now been met by enabling customers to select between three different types of Encoding Reserved Units.In this post, I will cover how you can use the new Encoding Reserved Units and the speed gains that you will get as a result.Until now, you as a user of Azure Media Services were able to log in to the Portal and change the number of encoding reserved units under the “Encoding” tab (as shown below):
This tab has now been updated to provide you the ability to select between three different types of Encoding Reserved Units (as shown below):
The three different encoding reserved units are labeled as Basic, Standard and Premium respectively.As a user, you can select any one of them and change the number of reserved units (up to your account quota) by using the slider.Changes on the Media Services account will go in to effect as soon as you click “Save”.</p>
