<p>We thought it would be fun to create a league of stores that are pioneers of the LemonStand 2 SaaS platform.The LemonStand Pioneer League (LPL) will work directly with our CTO, Aleksey (the coach?), to get up and running on the LemonStand SaaS Beta, selling real products to real customers.Stores that are drafted will receive personalized (and free) integration and consultation.Weâ€™ll bring on new stores in rounds.</p>
