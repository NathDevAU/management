<p>It’s been a big day for us at 3scale with the announcement of our new $4.2 Million investment from Javelin Venture Partners and Costanoa VC!Those that know the company will be aware that we founded the company to help people open up APIs and create a whole new world of opportunities.This is something we’ve stuck to from then on and the new funding will provide an amazing huge boost to achieving that!Before talking about what new heights we plan to reach though :), … we wanted to say a HUGE THANK YOU!</p>
