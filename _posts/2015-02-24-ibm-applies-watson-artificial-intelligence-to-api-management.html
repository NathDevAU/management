<p>IBM today unveiled a range of products and services designed to advance the state of API integration, including the API Harmony service running on the IBM Bluemix integration platform that the company claims will make it simpler to identify the contextual relationship between different APIs.IBM is using the IBM Watson cognitive computing service to both identify the relationship between APIs and make recommendations about what APIs to use to build certain classes of applications.Meg Swanson, marketing director for Bluemix, says that API Harmony, launched at the IBM InterConnect Cloud 2015 conference, pulls public APIs into a central database that enables Watson to analyze their attributes.Additionally, organizations can create their own databases that can include a mix of private and public APIs that supposedly makes it easier for developers to bind up different classes of services.By applying Watson to APIs, IBM claims it is revolutionizing API management by applying artificial intelligence in way that makes developers more efficient.</p>
