<p>In our previous article on API analytics, we saw how API producers could learn more about how their APIs are used thanks to some pretty graphs showing the number of calls, the HTTP methods and status codes being used, where in the world calls are coming from, or what client was used to make those calls.Today, we’re going to have a closer look at API calls, to see who called you recently and with what outcome.Head over to the Messages tab of your API.You’ll see a Messages and Traces section which tell you about recent events for this Web API cell, like recent deployments of the API, etc.But we’re interested in the last section called Latest API calls:
You can see a list of recent calls made to your API, showing:
the HTTP method used,
and the date and time of the call.</p>
