<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a globally recognized organization that sets quality standards for products, services, and industries.We might see the ‘ISO certified’ label on the website of our favorite non-profit, the back of a chocolate bar, or the packaging of our toothbrush.Their aim as an organization is to establish a standard of efficiency, safety, and equity for our environment and the products and services we encounter everyday.Now the ISO has published a set of standards that encapsulates this mission entirely.Their newest set of indicators, ISO 37120, addresses the cities in which we live, work, and play, evaluating city services and quality of life.</p>
