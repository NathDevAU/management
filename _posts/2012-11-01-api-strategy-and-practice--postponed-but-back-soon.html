<p>As you likely gathered from our Twitter feed and emails unfortunately this week Mother Nature in the form of Hurricane Sandy reminded us all that the best laid plans sometimes had to yield and we were forced to postpone the conference due to the Storm conditions in New York.We’d been working to make the event happen right up until monnday and had our fingers crossed it would still be workable – speakers and sponsors were truely remarkable in their willingness to travel and make it happen!However, as Tuesday AM rolled around and the devastation because clear we had to make the postponement decision with saftey concerns for speakers/attendees and travel looking chaotic to say the least for most people.The pictures of the aftermath of the storm are simply stunning: cnn and bbcworld both have galleries.So while it as a tough blow to have to postpone, the scale of the disaster puts it in perspective – the conference will be back very shortly with new dates, the same great speakers and no doubt, even more energy!</p>
