{% include JB/setup %}<p>This is a challenging topic since great support is hard to pin down and has that “you know it when we see it, but kind of hard to define” type of quality.When trying to pin it down, it would be easy to put together put together a list of buzzwords (timely, friendly, to the point etc.) and leave it at that.Beyind, this we also typically think of support as purely the human interactions which we experience when requesting support.However, beyond these, potentially it helps to think of API support first and foremost from the point of view of the customer (the developer in this case):
 As a user of this API, support is everything that enables me to get my job done, to be successful, to ship…
 In other words, what developers ultimately care about is shipping the Apps in as painless and efficient a manner as possible.</p>
