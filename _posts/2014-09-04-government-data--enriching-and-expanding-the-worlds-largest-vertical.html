I think it’s important to state the obvious – government data is unique in the world of data.Most data that we’ve highlighted over the past generation – a generation, by the way, that has witnessed the revolution of information technology – has obsessively focused on running, managing, automating and organizing the enterprise in an effort to wring out every last drop of business transaction and process efficiency.  We’ve also seen scientific data in the spotlight, especially in the realm of data base management and, more recently, big data.But government data is completely different.</p>
