<p>It’s election season and all over America people are listening to politicians talk up the great work they have done over the past four years: more extensive after school programs, rental assistance for veterans, clean energy tax incentives, et cetera.But what specifically are they talking about?And, how, if you’re interested, can you actually apply for these programs and funds?
