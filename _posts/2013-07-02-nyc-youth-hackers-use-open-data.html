<p>Last weekend, dozens of young hackers and coders took part in an age 18-and-under open data hackathon known as Young Rewired State – New York City.  Young Rewired State (YRS) is the youth-focused branch of Rewired State, a network of software developers, engineers and civic activists based in the United Kingdom.YRS New York City, held at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, was YRS’ first-ever youth coding event held abroad, and precedes similar events to be held in Berlin, Joannesburg, Aarhaus and San Francisco later this year. 
 Volunteer mentors with design, coding, or data experience also attended the event, assisting teams throughout the weekend with idea refinement, code debugging, and beautification.(There was even a graphics bar staffed by graphic designers delivered turnkey, web-ready images for those teams who requested them.</p>
