This story is derived from listening to the API podcast, Traffic and Weather.One of the things John Sheehan (@johnsheehan), and Steve Marx (@smarx) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called How many HTTP status codes should your API use?I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy.John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes.To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback.</p>
