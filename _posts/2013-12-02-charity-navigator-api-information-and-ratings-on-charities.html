<p>At Charity Navigator we believe that people are amazingly generous and derive great satisfaction from helping others, but are not always sure how to help.So we built an objective rating system that assists givers with every type of charitable interest in finding a charity to support.Providing our data to developers via our API is a key component to achieving our goal of helping all donors everywhere make informed charitable giving decisions.Interview Sandra Miniutti, Vice President of Marketing and CFO for Charity Navigator.In her role, she is responsible for all aspects of Charity Navigator’s brand, all partnerships, media relations, communications, outreach, data sales and the organization’s finances.</p>
