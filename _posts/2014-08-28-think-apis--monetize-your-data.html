<p>This is the API entry point that you have probably heard the most about.“Monetize your data” is based on externalizing insight or function in a form that entices third parties to “pay” for its use.Importantly, payment can be in many forms and is often not even of a monetary nature.For instance, on-boarding partners via APIs is a use case for the “Monetize your data” entry point.So are cases where you are actually paying someone to use your APIs, the return value being a broadening of reach and a strengthening of ecosystem.</p>
