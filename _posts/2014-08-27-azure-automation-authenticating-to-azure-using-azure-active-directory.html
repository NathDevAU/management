<p>If you’re a user of Azure Automation, you already know how useful it can be for automating manual, long running, frequently repeated, and error prone tasks that keep your cloud services up and running.You may also be well aware that there are a number of steps required to get Azure Automation set up to talk to Azure using certificate-based authentication.Well we on the Azure Automation and Azure PowerShell team are happy to present you with an easier alternative – Azure Automation can now authenticate to Azure using organization identity credential-based authentication, using Azure Active Directory.Azure Automation now ships with the Azure PowerShell module of version 0.8.</p>
