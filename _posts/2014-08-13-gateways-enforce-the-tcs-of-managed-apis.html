<p>As discussed in earlier blogs, the key distinction between a managed API and an unmanaged API is that, well, the managed API is “under management”  
A managed API has appropriately enforced business and IT controls, which in turn begs the question of where and how those controls are enforced at runtime.Enforcing the controls in code is generally a bad idea.For one thing it is notoriously unreliable, depending on the code quality of every single API implementation.Furthermore, an organization really needs the ability to change the controls without having to change and re-deploy the API itself.In other words the controls should be policy driven with independently managed policies defining the (business and IT) operational intent and the API runtime enforcing that intent.</p>
