<p>Monitoring is a critical component of a production online application.A properly implemented monitoring system would enable you to receive alerts for key events and react appropriately.In this post, I will go over some sample code that I wrote to monitor a Media Services account.You can use the sample code as a starting point to start planning your own custom monitoring system for your application built on top of Media Services.At a high level, the sample code provided works on the principle of executing some code against the service at regular intervals.</p>
