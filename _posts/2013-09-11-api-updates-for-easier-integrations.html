<p>Default payment terms are now accessible, both at an organisation-wide level and also for individual contacts.These defaults are only applied in the Xero app, but are useful if you want to retrieve the Xero defaults so you can offer these as options in your app too.The Profit &amp; Loss and Balance Sheet reports have been made more flexible so you can retrieve these using the standard layout rather than a user specified version, particularly useful for our growing range of reporting tool partners.Expected and planned payments dates can now also be retrieved for individual invoices so cashflow management apps can put this data to great use.The Payroll API has also been updated with a Settings endpoint to allow easier setup options when initially connecting to Xero.</p>
