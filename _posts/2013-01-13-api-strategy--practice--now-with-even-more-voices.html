<p>As we’ve been gearing up for API Strategy and Practice on the new dates (21-22nd February) we’ve had more and more suggestions for great talks and content we couldn’t accomodate – the program will be intense and Jam packed.So we colluded with Kin over at Api Evangelist to brainstorm up a solution.So in true open fashion we hit upon something which seemed right – the 429 Stage: an extra open stage at which everybody can grab the mic.Read the details over at API Start and (shortly on API Evangelist) but essentially we’re adding an extra room of networking/chillout space along with a small 20 seat presentation area that can be used by anybody.A sign-up form for talk proposals will be up in a day or two!</p>
