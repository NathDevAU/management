This is a topic I’ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant.This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what Id consider significantly overlapped.I’m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all Section 508 compliant, providing critical access to people with disabilities.In response to my recent post, on Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important”, said:
First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution.</p>
