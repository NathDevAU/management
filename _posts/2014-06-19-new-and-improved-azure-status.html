<p>Today we shipped a new and improved Azure Status (formerly – Service Health Dashboard).The new health dashboard, available on status.azure.com shows the overall health of the platform and for each of our services, and gives unauthenticated users the information they need in order to know what’s going on in case something goes wrong.You can can also subscribe to a RSS feed and be notified on every new incident we experience.</p>
