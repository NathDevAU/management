<p>I recently attended and participated in the API Strategy and Practice conference in San Fransisco OCT 23-25.This was an exceptional conference and I met a lot of new people and learned many new things.The panel I took part in is a panel discussion concerning  the API Economy.It was too short of a time slot do go very deep into the subject, but the moderator—Brian Proffitt—did a great job and the questions were interesting and relevant.In retrospect, there was something curious missing from all of the presentations and conversations at the conference—the lack of discussion about the role of identity access management and APIs.</p>
