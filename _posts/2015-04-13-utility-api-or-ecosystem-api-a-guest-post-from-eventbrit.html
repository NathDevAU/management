<p>We are delighted to host a special guest post from Mitch Colleran.Mitch is a Product Manager at Eventbrite where he focuses on building their extensions platform, Eventbrite Spectrum , and developer community.In 2011, I started working on building an API program for Eventbrite.We were much much smaller and API platforms weren’t the hot topic that they are today.Eventbrite only had one successful API integration with MailChimp; it was my mandate to drive more developer activity on the API, which we assumed would drive business value, but we weren’t sure how we would connect the two.</p>
