<p>I didn’t always work at Splunk.In fact, many moons ago I used to be a Splunk customer.At the time we were simply looking for a means to better consolidate our enterprise’s numerous sources of log data into a centralized repository.A colleague of mine mentioned this product called Splunk , and hence the journey began.Like many, this started with getting some log files indexed into Splunk and creating some trivial searches and Simple XML dashboards.</p>
