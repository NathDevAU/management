<p>Weber’s defines self-service as “the serving of oneself (as in a restaurant or gas station) with goods or services to be paid for at a cashier’s desk or by using a coin-operated mechanism or a credit or debit card.” Boring.When did self-service become so boring?In our experience, self-service is anything but.Studies show us that more and more customers prefer self-service over contacting a support agent.</p>
