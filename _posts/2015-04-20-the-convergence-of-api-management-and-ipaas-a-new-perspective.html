<p>Here at Cloud Elements, we’ve been talking a lot lately about the convergence of API Management and iPaaS.This topic has been something that we’ve been passionate about for some time, but over the course of the last few weeks, we’ve been more dialed-in on this notion.This is likely the result of recent conversations with different industry analyst firms and resulting reports that support our vision that integration platforms will converge with API management platforms.In fact, this week we announced that we were positioned in the “Visionaries” Quadrant of Gartner’s 2015 Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance for completeness of vision.Additionally, we also were positioned as a Niche Player in the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Integration Platform as a Service, Worldwide.</p>
