<p>Overlord is an IoT platform that provides an HTTP REST API for managing data from any device that can connect to the Web or any private network over TCP/IP.Overlord provides an API for managing devices, sensors, readings, channels, alerts, and messages.Devices can register sensors and push data to the server using a simple REST API.Sensor data grouped as channels can be streamed to subscribing devices using a simple request-response model where the client resends the ID of the last stream data it processed.Devices can set alerts on sensors or channels, and these can be set and triggered by sensor data exceeding some threshold value.</p>
