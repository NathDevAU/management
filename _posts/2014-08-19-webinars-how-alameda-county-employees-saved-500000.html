<p>In September 2013, Tim Dupuis, Chief Information Officer/Registrar of Voters for Alameda County, held “Rethink AC,” the County’s inaugural employees-only hackathon.On that day, an idea emerged for automated invoicing.The County recognized the potential of this idea, worked to develop it, and implemented it on April 1, 2014.The new invoicing app establishes a system that reduces the time required for verification from 40 hours to eight hours.It has also reduced annual scanning and storage costs by more than $500,000.</p>
