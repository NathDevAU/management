<p>We no longer even think about the fact that business centric people routinely publish new or changed content to web sites.We “know” that using a good content management system, bad things won’t happen even without strong controls.We simply trust the separation of the software platform from the content running on that platform.That same trust, intrinsic to the world of the web, is quickly creeping into the way we build mobile apps.The separation of platform from content is the new normal; the way to present relevant and up to date information on the client side of an engaging experience.</p>
