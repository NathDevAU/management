<p>With organizations now routinely monetizing APIs, developers are being asked to provide more insight into how data is flowing into and out of those APIs.To help developers achieve that goal Apigee this week announced that it has extended the analytics capabilities of the Apigee Edge API platform.Ed Anuff, vice president of product strategy for Apigee, says developers are being asked to provide information about the metadata surrounding their APIs.Rather than having to acquire a separate environment to accomplish that goal, Apigee is exposing more analytics within the same platform developers use to manage and build APIs, says Anuff.The specific additions that Apigee is making address API performance latency and how users on various types of devices are engaging with a particular API.</p>
