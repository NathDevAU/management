<p>At the Oracle OpenWorld 2014 conference today, Oracle made a major thrust toward bridging the gap between enterprise IT systems and mobile applications with the preview of Mobile Application Accelerator, a rapid application development tool, and the launch of a new cloud integration service.Via a new Oracle Integration Cloud Service, Oracle Cloud Adapters and an Oracle Cloud Adapter Software Development Kit (SDK), the company now provides multichannel delivery of applications and services across mobile, Web, B2B and cloud applications using new API management capabilities, REST APIs and JSON adapters, says Thomas Kurian, executive vice president for product development.As part of that offering, Kurian says, Oracle provides complete API life cycle management, including definition, creation, publishing, security, monitoring and management of APIs across private, public and hybrid clouds.At the same time, Oracle also previewed Mobile Application Accelerator, which is designed to enable end users to create their own applications by invoking Oracle cloud services that are exposed via RESTful APIs.The Mobile Application Accelerator is an extension of the Oracle Mobile Application Framework, which will be made available as a service on the Oracle Mobile Cloud.</p>
