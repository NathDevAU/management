<p>Microsoft recently held its first company-wide hackathon, where we created a new visualizer tool for Kubernetes deployment on Azure.Alongside today’s announcement that Kubernetes can be used to manage your Docker containers on Microsoft Azure, we have also today released the code for the visualizer tool, which can be found here: Azure Kubernetes Visualizer GitHub Repository.Our project was to build a visualization system for what Kubernetes is doing when managing Docker on Azure.Kubernetes is a declarative cluster management system for a containerization technology called Docker.As described here, Docker offers “a portable, lightweight runtime and … enables apps to be quickly assembled…” The goal was to visually demonstrate some Docker and Kubernetes concepts such as containers, pods, labels, minions, and replication controllers.</p>
