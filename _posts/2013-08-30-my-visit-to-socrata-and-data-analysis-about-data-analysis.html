<p>A couple months ago, I downloaded the metadata files for all of the datasets on 60 Socrata open data portals.Interesting things happen when you do craziness like this.Last Friday, I visited Socrata in Seattle.The most important part of my visit was of course the teriyaki lunch; it was so important that Developer Evangelist Chris Metcalf sent me a Google Calendar invitation for it.They’ve been doing this for about 19 months and have only missed two weeks!</p>
