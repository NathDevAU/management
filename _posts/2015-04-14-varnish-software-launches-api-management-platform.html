<p>Using technology originally developed to accelerate HTTP traffic, Varnish Software has launched Varnish API Engine, an API management platform that the company claims can process as many as 20,000 API calls a second.Steve Raby, vice president of sales and marketing, says Varnish API Engine makes use of open source caching software already being used by 2.3 million websites to create an API management platform.Because the platform is based on open source software, Varnish Software has opted to charge only for the API management features it is including, such as support for throttling, high availability, authentication, authorization, metering and, of course, caching, Raby adds.In addition, because Varnish API Engine is based on open source software, Varnish Software has opted to charge customers a flat $47,000 annual subscription to use Varnish API Engine versus charging customers per API call made to the platform.</p>
