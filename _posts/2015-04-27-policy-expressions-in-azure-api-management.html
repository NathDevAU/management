<p>Azure API Management offers the ability to control and modify the behavior of published APIs using out-of-the-box policies that can be configured from the Publisher portal.These policies are applied to the inbound request or the outbound response in the API Management proxy that sits between the API consumer and the API backend.Policy expressions augment the ability of API Management policies, providing a sophisticated means to control traffic and modify API behavior without requiring you to write any code or modifying any backend services.You can use policy expressions as attribute values or text values in most API Management policies.Policy expressions use the C# 6.</p>
