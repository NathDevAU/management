<p>Documentation is the first touch point for those curious about new software.This is especially true for APIs, because clear documentation makes it easy to understand and use – it is often the make-or-break point for new users.As an increasing number of people read and use the documentation for the cognitive services that we deliver in the Watson Developer Cloud (WDC), the WDC documentation team receives plenty of feedback – some positive, some negative, but all useful.We want to learn from that feedback, and improve both the documentation and the experience of using it.Sounds something like the WDC services themselves, doesn’t it?</p>
