<p>In this post we will continue the conversation about the business continuity scenarios and discuss the newly released Standard Geo-Replication feature of Azure SQL Database.Standard Geo-Replication allows you to configure your database to asynchronously replicate committed transactions from the primary database to the secondary in a predefined Azure region.Before diving into the details it would be useful to summarize the full range of the business continuity features now available in preview and discuss them in the context of the new service tiers we announced in April 2014.You can find the details of the specific characteristics of the service tiers in this article.In the previous post on Active Geo-Replication, Tobias already defined the business continuity challenge.</p>
