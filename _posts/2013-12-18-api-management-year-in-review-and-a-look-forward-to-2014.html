<p>As an organization that started publishing APIs ten years ago on behalf of other organizations with our API self-publishing platform (called Web Services back then), and now serving thousands of customers with our API-centric business models and servicing billions of monetized transactions, we have seen many changes in the API management industrys landscape.With this in mind, there is no question that 2013 has been an important year for API management.There have been several large investments in the space in the first half of the year and some noteworthy consolidation has occured with the Intel acquisition of Mashery, the Microsoft acquisition of Apiphany, and the Computer Associates acquisition of Layer 7.Several analyst firms have initiated coverage of the API management space.This all occurs at a time when both the number of APIs commercially available and the adoption of APIs is increasing dramatically.</p>
