<p>At Google, we know that you want to be more productive when building apps.We’ve been listening to your feedback and — based on your comments and ideas — have begun prototyping new ways to make Developers Console more useful, usable, beautiful  and well crafted.Our first improvement is to reduce wasted space in the Developers Console user interface (UI).You told us you could be more productive if the UI took up less space.We responded by optimizing the layout for scanability.</p>
