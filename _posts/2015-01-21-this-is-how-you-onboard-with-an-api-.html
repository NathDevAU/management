I sign up for a lot of APIs, and when I encounter a frictionless on-boarding process, I feel the need to showcase, and help everyone understand how important it is to make the process as easy as possible.Im still amazed at how many new APIs make this really, really hard.I will write a separate story after this about how not to on-board with an API, but for now lets take a look at a kick-ass example.This example comes from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API.When it comes to signing up for API access, the only thing that can make this easier is providing an API for the process, but for right from the home page you can signup for an API key.</p>
