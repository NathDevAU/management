<p>I’m going to take a quick break from my industry tour of APIs to cover two questions I’ve been asked about quite often recently:
Before attacking the questions, there is a basic statement about Governance that I have been using for the last 10 years that can help with this discussion.That is, “Governance should make it easy for people to do things the right way and hard for people to do things the wrong way”.In general the least intrusive approach to governance that accomplishes this is the best option.Looking at the second question, “Is this (API Governance) analogous to what we did for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Governance?” the short answer is “No”.</p>
