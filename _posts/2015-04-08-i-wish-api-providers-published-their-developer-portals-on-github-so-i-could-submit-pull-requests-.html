I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers.I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these  portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about.Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API.During these travels, I got to thinking.what if API providers published their developer portals to Github?</p>
