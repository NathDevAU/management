<p>Google’s announced that it’s making it easier for developers to integrate Google Maps services into their apps.It’s been making them available through a JavaScript Maps API for some time but has now added Java and Python libraries.The new Java and Python Google Maps libraries support the Directions API, Distance Matrix API, Elevation API, Geocoding API and Time Zone API.Google says developers can rely on the code in the client libraries to interface with those services and spend more time developing unique features for their apps.Java developers can find the code at Google’s GitHub repository.</p>
