<p>Following on the heels of last weekâ€™s announcement, I am pleased to announce more news about our efforts to deliver a rich, connected set of data services on Azure, as part of our broader data platform.In September we will make available the new service tiers for Azure SQL Database, our database-as-a-service that gives customers greater price performance and business continuity for cloud apps.During the preview, we have actively listened and responded to customer feedback to tune our offerings for general availability.Per your feedback, we are reducing the service tier prices from previously-announced rates, introducing a new performance level and offering hourly billing.In addition, we are providing an enhanced service-level agreement (SLA) of 99.</p>
