<p>We’ve always been proud to offer the full sophistication of the Evernote platform to all developers to build on.You have access to the same complete API that our own client apps are built on, so you can do anything we can. What that has too often meant, though, is that you’ve had to understand a lot of that sophistication before accomplishing basic tasks.The more complex technology— for example shared notebooks and Evernote Business notebooks — has been challenging to support without expertise and a fair bit of code.We’re starting to change that.</p>
