<p>The acronym API has come a long way.In 1980, asking about an API meant building something for a massive corporate software package.In the 1990s it meant building with the tools for a 3D card or a sound card.Today, however, the term tends to mean just one thing: RESTful Web APIs.And what we now call APIs have grown to encompass all forms of interfaces from all manner of places.</p>
