<p>Last month, we wrote about how New York City is raising the standard for open data innovation.Their outstanding work continues to receive accolades, most recently across the Atlantic from one of the world’s leading news sources.New York City was recently featured on the iconic BBC radio program “Today,” which reaches an average of six million listeners every week.In the segment, BBC North America correspondent Jonny Dymond introduces New York’s revolutionary use of open data for public good in this way:
 From every place in New York, information is pouring out—out of the parking meters, down the
 sides of the skyscrapers, in great waves down the broad avenues…the data of New York is
 gathered by the city for the people.In fact, the Big Apple’s redesigned NYC Open Data Portal, launched in September, added 200 new datasets to the site to bring the total to more than 1,100.</p>
