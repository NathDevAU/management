<p>Our customers have spoken and we’ve been listening: the much-anticipated Auditing feature is now available for Azure SQL DB, in a preview offering.This is a key security enhancement that removes barriers from businesses wanting to manage their databases in the cloud.Introduced to preview a couple of weeks ago, SQL Database Auditing increases an organization’s ability to gain deep insight into events and changes that occur within the database, including updates and queries against the data.Using a very simple and intuitive configuration interface, you can now have Auditing up and running on your database within minutes.See a demo and learn more about the benefits of Auditing in this lively and informative Channel 9 video in which Eyal Carmel and Scott Klein discuss this new capability.</p>
