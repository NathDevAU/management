<p>Last month, we announced support for deploying Docker on Azure Virtual Machines, using our extension technology to enable the high-density power of Docker as quickly and easily as possible.Continuing our commitment to give customers more open and community-driven choices, today we are announcing plans to work with Google and Docker to bring support for both Kubernetes and libswarm open source projects on the Microsoft Azure platform.Announced in June, Kubernetes is a declarative container management solution supporting orchestration and scheduling of Docker containers, originally built on top of Google Compute Engine.Microsoft Open Technologiesâ€™ contribution to this GitHub project will enable Kubernetes capabilities on top of Azure Linux Virtual Machines.This will offer additional options to our developers who want to use Linux containers and manage them with Kubernetes.</p>
