<p>The last 10 days have seen an impressive amount of change in the API space with Mashery and Layer7 both getting acquired, Mulesoft acquiring ProgrammableWeb from Alcatel Lucent and also our own announcement of $4.2 Million of investment.The moves are exciting and show that APIs are now becoming increasingly important to many businesses.Some great takes are already emerging on what it means for the space as a whole – see here, here and here and we figured we’d add some perspectives too.In addition to excitement about the space and great feedback we’ve had we also a had direct questions which we can happily answers!</p>
