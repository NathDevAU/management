{% include JB/setup %}<p>We just had two amazing days at API Strategy and Practice in New York with great conversations!A full review coming up – but on the way home we just wanted to share a few technical gems which stood out from the sessions:
  API Versioning can be personal: Stripe’s Amber Feng gave a great presentation of Stripe’s API design choices and one that stood out was how Stripe versioning is personal to each user such that the first API call determines the version associated with your account and the developer is able to explicitly choose when to upgrade or temporarily override.Awesome for the developer.It seems like it may cause challenging issues with version maintenance – but an interesting approach none-the-less.REST may not be enough – especially at Scale: In his Keynote Daniel Jacobson outlined the challenges of running Netflix API at massive scale and how pre-forming many of the commonly used views fully for common devices was key in reducing the chattiness (and hence load) of the API.</p>
