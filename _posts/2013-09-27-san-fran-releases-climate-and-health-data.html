<p>For over three years, the SFDPH’s Climate and Health Program has researched increasing local temperatures and how they affect vulnerable areas and populations in San Francisco.The Climate and Health dataset makes all of the program’s data freely available and easily searchable through DataSF, the city’s open data portal.The dataset includes satellite imagery from NASA and temperature data from NOAA.It also features data on factors that influence climate-related health risks, such as individual physiology, culture, local infrastructure, behavior, and social and demographic characteristics.The SFDPH hopes that publishing this data will inspire researchers, developers, and private citizens to create tools that will educate the public on dangers and safety measures surrounding environmental health concerns, ultimately helping to mitigate their impact.</p>
