<p>We know that busy small business owners hate waiting on the phone to speak to someone who often can’t even help them.We also want to ensure that when you talk to someone at Xero, that person can solve your problem, as quickly as possible.Trying to guess how many people to have sitting around waiting for customers to call is an impossible problem to solve.So we deliberately came up with a different model, where you can tell us the problem, automatically giving us as much information as possible, then get on with your business.Then one of our Xero customer experience (CX) team can have a look at what’s going on, let you know what to do, or give you a call to sort things out.</p>
