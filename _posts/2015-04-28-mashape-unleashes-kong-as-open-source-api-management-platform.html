<p>As part of an effort to enable IT organizations to provide API management capabilities wherever they might be needed, Mashape today announced it is making the Kong API management platform that powers its namesake API marketplace openly available.Montana Flynn, head of product at Mashape, says that as IT organizations move away from monolithic applications, they need access to an API management platform that is optimized to support modern deployment of “microservices” based on technologies such as Docker containers.Based on the proxy server from NGINX and the NoSQL Cassandra database, Flynn says Kong can scale to support 20,000 API calls per second.IT organizations can now take advantage of that same API management horsepower on a local server that can be deployed on premise or in a hosted cloud service that scales out as each new server is added to the distributed computing environment, says Flynn.In addition to being deployed in support for enterprise IT applications, Flynn adds that Mashape also expects to see Kong deployed as an API gateway in support of Internet of Things (IoT) applications.</p>
