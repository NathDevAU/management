<p>On the heals of the Unblight Conference, which brought together advocates, policy makers, and technologists to “share lessons about combatting blight and repurposing abandoned parts of communities,” it seems a good time to turn Data Into Dollars toward Civic Insight.  
Developed in 2012 by Code for America fellows, Civic Insight is an app making government open data about vacancy, code enforcement, and other complicated processes into information citizens can use.It benefits citizens and governments by providing a single, real-time communication stream.  
The citizen-facing side of Civic Insight helps residents transform their communities by providing understandable updates about where they are in the city’s permitting process.Civic Insight pulls government open data and transforms it into clear language with step-by-step progress reports.</p>
