<p>Freedom to innovate is the most important imperative for many businesses today.Try early, learn fast, scale easily – key characteristics of a dynamic, engaging enterprise.The focus for this (second) API entry point is to chase business opportunity aggressively and to make innovation a learning process
 - Everything is a prototype… until proven in practice
- Learning that something didn’t work is not failing… it is just learning
- Standing still… equals guaranteed decline
The role of APIs is to provide the calm center in the “eye of the storm of change”.This has two aspects:
- Deliver quickly what the experimenting API consumer needs (and remove it again when no longer needed)
- Protect the provider from churn (remember from an earlier blog that defining and deploying new API “views” on existing assets should be easy and cheap)
The Freedom to Innovate entry point is perhaps not as glamorous as Monetize your data, but is by far the API use case that I see the most in major Enterprises.The ability to compose new innovative capabilities, internal and/or external, without breaking the bank in terms of cost, is something that everyone is struggling with.</p>
