<p>This weekend at the excellent APIDays conference in San Francisco (props to Webshell and Faber Novel for a great event!), we got the chance to think out of the box a little and present thoughts on what impact APIs might have at a wider scale.As with everyone else in the industry, it’s natural that we’re often absorbed in the day to day if drilling down to individual technical challenges or choices.Sometimes however, it’s interesting to take a step back and when we do we’re continually surprised at how broad and deep the impact of APIs is likely to be.While the wording may seem extreme, both the continual pace of adoption of software in many industries and the adoption of APIs onto these software layers is having transformative effects.</p>
