<p>Today, I made someone at work cry.I asked him what life would be like without APIs.“That would be the worst day ever!” he replied, holding his head in his hands.He was kidding and just pretending to cry, but after we started talking about a world without APIs, it didn’t seem as funny anymore.</p>
