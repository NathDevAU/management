I was reading Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys?from Daryl Miller (@darrel_miller) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back.My thoughts are only related to Daryll’s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility—the similarities stop there.Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about.API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue.</p>
