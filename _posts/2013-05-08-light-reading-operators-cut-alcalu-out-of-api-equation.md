{% include JB/setup %}<p>Sarah, At first I thought your comment regarding carrier finding a business model was limited to wireline and telco in particular but as I work on carrier network architecture across.Telco Alcatel-Lucent has been pursuing application enablement as a top-down initiative from the CEO since 2009, but the market has changed in the past four years, and the vendor is finding it no longer has a role -- or a business model -- for helping operators expose their application programming interfaces (APIs).In fact, Alcatel-Lucent isnt playing the role of intermediary between operators and developers at all any more.As part of its reorganization, it sold off the API repository it acquired in 2010, ProgrammableWeb, to MuleSoft, noting that its operator customers would rather see it embed its own APIs into its platforms like IMS and SDN than work to expose their own.(See AlcaLu Sells Off its API Repository.</p>
