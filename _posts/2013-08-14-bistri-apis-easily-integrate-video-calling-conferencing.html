<p>WebRTC offers developers a great opportunity to re-build the user experience of video calls and video conference totally on new bases.As a platform we want to offer developers the best toolbox, easy to apply from the beginner to the advanced developer.The developers have a total control of the look and feel, the UX, the UI.They build their own Video Calling, Video Conferencing application, they are focused on the user experience, and the Bistri platform take care of the technical things behind the scenes like the differences of implementation of WebRTC between Chrome and Firefox, or the ICE infrastructure (STUN, TURN) to make the flows going through firewalls.Today, we have a Javascript API, Javascript Widgets, WordPress Widgets.</p>
