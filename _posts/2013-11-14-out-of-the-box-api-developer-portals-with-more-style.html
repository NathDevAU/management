<p>Creating a good experience for your developers is must have for your API.To make this easier weâ€™ve been working hard to update the out-of-box developer portals available automatically in the 3scale system.The new release is now live and available in new accounts created from now on.The portals now come with:
 Updated styles and look and feel so you can get rolling quickly
 Responsive design and built in toolbars to quickly change colors and feel 
 Powerful Tag System to control the user experience
 Automatic Example active documentation to explore your APIs
 
 The biggest change is putting in place nicer initial styles so you can get up and running quickly.These styles cover the developer portal homepage as well as internal views such as key access and messaging.</p>
