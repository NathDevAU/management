<p>Each year we like to recognize a person who has contributed significantly to the Xero API developer community.The API and Developer Relations team have the privilege of connecting with an exceptionally talented group of designers, developers and company founders all over the world.Like iOS and Android developer communities, the Xero Developer community is a big part of what defines Xero as the platform for small business.They make a difference in the lives of small business owners through the creativity and care they bring to their products.As we thought about integrations launched in 2014, the one that stood out was developed by Julian Applebaum at Squarespace.</p>
