<p>Our #1 job here at Keen IO is to maintain the reliability and stability of our API.As you might expect, we’ve put a number of limits and protections in place to safeguard the service and make sure existing customers are protected.Today, we had a couple questions come up about the forms of limiting we’ve employed over the last couple weeks.In all the hubub we may’ve lacked a clear explanation of each, so I’ll give one now.We also updated our documentation related to each of these today.</p>
