<p>This week, grocery stores across the country recalled several kinds of fruit due to contamination concerns.If you heard about the recall, it was probably thanks to social media or television news — both of which work great in these situations when you have widespread (or some other sensationalistic) concern.  
But how do you know if some other product you own (say an eyelash curler or your home’s thermostat) has been recalled?Unless you were really diligent about completing warrantee cards (is there even an eyelash curler warrantee card?) you might never find out there was an issue.</p>
