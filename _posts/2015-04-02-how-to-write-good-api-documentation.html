<p>This might seem obvious, but involves more thought than you might realize.Think about how a conversation with a colleague is much different than a conversation with a child in terms of vocabulary, background knowledge assumptions, and guidance.For example, take a look at a children’s book and an adult’s mystery book.Notice that the two books are completely different in terms of detail, clues, and length?The children’s book will not only guide the child to each of the clues but will also bluntly point out each clue and how it contributes to the mystery.</p>
