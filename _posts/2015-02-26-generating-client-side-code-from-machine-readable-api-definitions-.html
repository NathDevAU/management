This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote.It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger.The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand.I’m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things.Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format Swagger, they launched a library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages.</p>
