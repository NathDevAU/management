<p>Here at Socrata, we seek to highlight the great work other organizations in the open data movement are doing.Today we shine a spotlight on Groupshot, an organization whose mission states, “Good design amplifies the potential in human networks.” Adam White is the principal co-founder of Groupshot.He spoke with Socrata about his work. 
 “I have been working as a design researcher to identify ways for data, particularly open data, to have more impact in different communities in the world,” White says.</p>
