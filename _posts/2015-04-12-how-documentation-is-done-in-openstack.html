<p>We use git extensively for documentation in OpenStack so that we can treat the docs like the code—and I’m seeing this trend many places especially in the Write the Docs community.Check out these talks from the 2014 Write the Docs event in Portland:
In OpenStack, we have documentation workflows that mimic our code collaboration.We post patches for people to review, we review each other’s patches (similar to a pull request on GitHub), and we have build and test automation for every doc patch.The idea is, use the collaboration present in the GitHub pull request workflow for docs as well as code.Were all responsible for relevant and accurate documentation for about 25 OpenStack projects written in Python across 130 git repositories, so lets collaborate together.</p>
