<p>One of the most satisfying things I can do as a program manager at Socrata is to make a customer feature request a reality.Like telling a well-timed joke or catching a game-winning pass.Multiply that feeling times 1,000 for the release of the new charting library on the Socrata platform.For months, we’ve been collecting requests, wishes, and wouldn’t-it-be-nice ideas for how to make the charting experience in Socrata even better.I’m incredibly proud of the hard-working team that has rebuilt our charts from the ground up, using the d3 toolkit to tailor charts to the specific demands of our customers: huge datasets, all major browsers, and dynamic data.</p>
