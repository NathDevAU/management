<p>We are excited to announce that MyGet is now available in the Microsoft Azure Store.  MyGet provides hosted NuGet Servers, allowing developers to create and host their own NuGet feeds with their own packages as well as other package sources such as NuGet.org.   MyGet already provides a popular integration with Visual Studio Online, and now via the Azure Store, Azure developers can manage their MyGet package management solution in one portal, alongside their Azure services.Having MyGet available in the Microsoft Azure Store allows developers and team leads to create MyGet accounts for themselves or their team members, whether free or one of the paid plans.</p>
