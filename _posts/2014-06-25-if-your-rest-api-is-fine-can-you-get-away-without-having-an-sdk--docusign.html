<p>There is an interesting debate between whether, as a platform company, you should provide just the API or build more SDKs.  A number of technology experts say that if you have a clean REST API, you really shouldn’t need an SDK.  Maybe your SDK is just covering up a bad API design?  In my experience SDKs greatly improve the success of 3rd party developers and it makes a difference, so while you can get away without having an SDK, you can however benefit from having one.Don’t make your developers do the plumbing A few years ago, we launched a REST API that was developed in conjunction with some of the best thought leaders we could recruit.</p>
