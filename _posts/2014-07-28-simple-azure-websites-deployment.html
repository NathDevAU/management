<p>My preferred method of deploying to an Azure Web Site is using git, partially because this is a feature I’ve been involved with from the beginning (it’s known as Kudu).However, in some cases, I just need to deploy a bunch of files from my local machine with minimal fuss, and using git is overkill.For these scenarios WebDeploy (aka msdeploy) really shines.The challenge with WebDeploy is that using it from the command line can take some getting used-to.After you download the publishing profile (from the Azure Websites dashboard), you have to extract a bunch of chunks from it.</p>
