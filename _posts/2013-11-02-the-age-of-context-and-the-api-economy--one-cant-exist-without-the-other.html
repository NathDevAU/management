<p>At the APIStrat conference last week there was a great panel on the API Economy and we were lucky enough to have Craig Burton speaking (thank you Craig).As a follow up he’s kindly agreed to share with us the occasional guest blog post on the API Economy and we’re happy to host them – he also writes at craigburton.com and tweets @craigburton.This is the first and one we couldn’t agree with more – the Age of Context is definitely upon us – but APIs are going to play a large part in makeing it happen.Over to Craig!</p>
