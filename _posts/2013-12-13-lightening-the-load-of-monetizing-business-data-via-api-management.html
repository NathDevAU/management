<p>This month, we announced the launch of StrikeIron’s API management platform, IronCloud.There’s a lot of excitement around StrikeIron about this launch, and I wanted to take you behind the scenes to see why.IronCloud is the industry’s first end-to-end turnkey solution for API management that focuses on data monetization for business.The big question we had in mind as the IronCloud launch developed was: Why should moving your data to the cloud require so much heavy lifting?This is especially true for non-technical business management areas of a company.</p>
