<p>Azure Site Recovery, with its Disaster Recovery to Azure capabilities, can now protect your workloads and recover them in Azure as IAAS VMs.Brad Anderson announced the preview of disaster recovery to Azure on the 19th of June.Since then we have seen a massive uptake of the feature with customers protecting and recovering their virtual machines in Azure.If you haven’t already started using the service check out the Teched video and sign up for the service.In this short blog we will look at how you can take advantage of a Azure Site Recovery feature called the Recovery Plan to make disaster recovery to Azure consistently accurate, repeatable and automated.</p>
