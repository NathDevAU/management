<p>This piece was submitted as a position paper for the W3Cs Workshop on Social Standards: The Future of Business, due to be held on August 7-8, 2013, in San Francisco.Much has been written about both the power of APIs to connect social applications in powerful ways, and vendor lock-in in the context of those APIs.Rather than usher in a new era of interoperability and open computing, APIs have allowed vendors to create new ways to lock users into their ecosystems.In many verticals, simply gaining access to a product’s API documentation is enough to require complicated licensing arrangements, vendor evaluation of your business intent for the API, and often, an asymmetric Non-Disclosure Agreement.“Open” is the new closed: too often, the API is a proprietary product in itself.</p>
