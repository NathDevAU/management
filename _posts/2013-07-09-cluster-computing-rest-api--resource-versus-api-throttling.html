<p>REST APIs should have cost associated with the resources rather than the APIs because there is no limit on the number of calls made per API.If the response sizes can be reduced with inline filter, then it directly translates to savings for both the sender and the receiver.Some of the performance degradations occur due to : premature optimization guessing caching everything fighting the framework Performance can be improved with Request distribution per hour, most requested, http statuses returned, request duration, failed requests etc all help with the analysis.Server logs can carry all this information.Tools to parse the logs for finding these information could help.</p>
