<p>You might have noticed in the news recently that ESPN has shut down its public API program.According to ESPN, they are trying to “better align their engineering resources with their core product development,” though the actual reason seems to be that they want better control over their unique and licensed content, and better monetization, which public APIs may not offer.If you think that is surprising, then take a look at what Netflix did.The poster child for API programs for content distribution recently announced that they will be retiring their public API program by the end of the year.Daniel Jacobson, a visionary in the API field, suggests that their engineering resources will be concentrating on the growing number of devices and the customer base to better serve them.</p>
