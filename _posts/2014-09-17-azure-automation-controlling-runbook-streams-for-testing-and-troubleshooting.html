<p>When you use Azure Automation to create and run runbooks, two key tasks are the testing of runbooks during authoring and the troubleshooting of runbook jobs in production.  In both cases, you need your runbooks to produce useful log messages so that you can learn what is going on during execution.  Fortunately, PowerShell Workflow, the engine that powers Azure Automation runbooks, has multiple message streams that you can control for optimal benefit during testing and troubleshooting.  In this post, I will cover some concepts and best practices for controlling runbook streams that will help you debug and troubleshoot your runbooks.The Azure Automation runbook authoring page is where you create runbooks.</p>
