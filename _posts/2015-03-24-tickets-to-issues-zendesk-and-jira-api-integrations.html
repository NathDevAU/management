<p>Good news!Zendesk and JIRA both use JSON.Zendesk’s response contains the object name at the top level with the rest of the data nested inside, but the request body does not contain this top-level resource name.JIRA’s payload contains basic information at the top level and a map of “fields” containing the rest of the information.In JIRA you can request further information by passing the “expand” parameter with a value of what you would like to expand.</p>
