<p>Microsoft Azure Files is a cloud based storage service that exposes SMB2.1 protocol based file shares in the cloud.Applications running in Azure can now easily share files between VMs using standard and familiar file system APIs like ReadFile and WriteFile.In addition, the files can also be accessed at the same time via a REST interface, which opens a variety of hybrid scenarios.Finally, Azure Files is built on the same technology as the Blob, Table, and Queue Services, which means Azure Files is able to leverage the existing availability, durability, scalability, and geo redundancy that is built into our platform.</p>
