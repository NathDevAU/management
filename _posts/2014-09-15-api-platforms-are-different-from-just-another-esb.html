<p>Have you ever heard someone say “I already have an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) so I am all set for APIs”?The implication is that API middleware is “just another ESB” … An assumption that I personally disagree with.APIs are ideally defined by configuration rather than coding.This preserves the light weight nature of the API proxy and supports the fast turn-around for new and changed APIs.General purpose ESB tooling is flow or code centric and service implementations are part of the enterprise Software Delivery Lifecycle.</p>
