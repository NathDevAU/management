Running the perfect API operation is pretty much a delusional dream.Even leaders  like Twilio and AWS have platform, and ecosystem produced problems on a regular basis.In my opinion, API are all about the journey, and we may never get our strategy 100% perfect, we can communicate, and evolve along the way—this is what I consider the API journey.To help demonstrate this in action, here a post from the GSA, about the SAM API, on the US Government API Forum:
Weve, rightfully, heard complaints about the SAM API languishing and the documentation not being as functional as it needs to be.We want to make sure users of the API feel comfortable using it to build real applications off of.</p>
