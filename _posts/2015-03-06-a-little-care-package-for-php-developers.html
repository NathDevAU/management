<p>As you’ve seen over the last couple of months, we’ve been pushing to improve our libraries on the major platforms you use.Today, we have a little treat for those of you sending email from PHP applications, but don’t need all the features the Postmark-PHP provides.As you probably know, Swiftmailer is the de facto standard for sending complex emails from PHP.We’re pleased to announce that we now provide an official transport for Swiftmailer that you can use to send email through Postmark. 
For most people using Swiftmailer, the Postmark Transport will require only a few lines of code to change, and you can start benefiting from our awesome deliverability rates, tracking, and bounce handling.</p>
