<p>Today marks the official launch of Connecticut’s capital city’s open data portal.HartfordData went live a few months ago, and has already started to meet the goals of  the City’s open data initiative. Hartford’s Chief Information Officer, Sabina Sitaru, and GIS Manager, Brett Flodine, are very enthusiastic about the possibilities for open data in their city.Inspired by the State of Connecticut’s recent adoption of an open data platform, Hartford’s Mayor, Pedro Segarra provided unfaltering support for the initiative and hopes to be an open data leader for mid-sized cities in the North East. 
Like many cities that implement an open data initiative, Hartford seeks to  increase transparency within the City, make data available for better decision-making on both internal and external fronts, and reduce FOI requests for data.</p>
