<p>At 3scale we’ve been following the amazing story of Pied Piper, the hot new startup of Silicon Valley, for more than a year now.We were in the audience when they won TechCrunch Disrupt, and we’ve gotten really excited about the potential of the team.When we heard about their compression algorithm – you know us – we immediately thought of wrapping it into an API, which is way easier to offer than a codec.A codec means people have to integrate it into their applications and write specific code to make it work on all the platforms.Without support from industry leaders, it won’t be widely adopted.</p>
