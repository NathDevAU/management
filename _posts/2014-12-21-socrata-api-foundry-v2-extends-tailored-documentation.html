<p>Socrata API Foundry have launched a new feature that will minimize the gap between the two tiers of their existing documentation output system.The API Foundry v1 took a clients dataset and created developer-ready API documentation, complete with how to query and interact with the API.However, it also created a lower-tier output for normal Socrata datasets, which produced a lower-end developer experience.Socratas new automatic API documentation feature in v2, which is available immediately, generates Foundry-style API documents for every Socrata dataset.These documents will be integrated with the rest of Socrataâ€™s developer resources and documentation.</p>
