<p>Somewhere during my weekly monitoring I found the Fiber Locator API, which like all APIs, especially the ones that ask me to “request access”, I signed up for the service.Understanding where telecommunications companies have laid fiber optic cable, for me, equals a potentially valuable API resource—sure I would consider integrating these resources into my applications, and systems.I’m never a big fan of APIs, who make you request access vs self-service registration, but if the API has value, I jump through hoops, so I can can better understand what an API does, which according to the Fiber Locator site:
FiberLocator offers an application programming interface that gives you access to our database of over 265+ carriers, over 272,000 carrier lit buildings locations and 3,000+ data centers.We created our API services so that client companies can augment their own systems and analyses with our unique data sets.I filled out the form, providing my name, email, phone and company name, the provided the additional details: I am the API Evangelist, and I’d like to write a story about the Fiber Locator API.</p>
