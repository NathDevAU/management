<p>API adoption is exploding and with it the need to get a good handle on how to execute API programs at both a technical and strategic level: which standards to follow, how to reach developers, how to think about business models and reach your goals.To help navigate these challenges we’ve put together the API Strategy and Practice Conference together with Kin Lane at API Evangelist and a whole host of awesome sponsors and speakers.The Conference is on the 1st and 2nd of November and tickets are limited – so snap yours up!The aim is to provide smart insights from many of the worlds leading APIs and technology providers and in two days be a one stop to bootstrap your API Strategy as well as find out about many interesting APIs to use.Today, we’re excited to announce another batch of great speakers – including great people running APIs like Stripe, Spotify, NPR and Tumblr + smart technology people from companies like Apiary.</p>
