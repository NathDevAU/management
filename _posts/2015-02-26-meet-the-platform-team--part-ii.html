<p>We profiled part of our Platform team last month, but as it is our largest team here at Mendeley, we had to break it up into two parts.To be honest, we profiled the team in three parts, with the API team taking the lead back in August.Why is the team so big?Because all those lines of code translate into giving Mendeley the base it needs for all of the features that make Mendeley what it is today.Read through their individual bios and find out how the Platform team helps every single team at Mendeley.</p>
