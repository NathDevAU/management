<p>Great documentation is key to the success of any developer platform.While we believe the core Titanium SDK documentation is strong, we also know that it can always be improved, extended, or enhanced.And we also know that the people with the most practical experience using the SDK and Appcelerator Platform are you — the community of developers who use it everyday to build great mobile apps for fun and profit.We’d like to invite anyone interested to contribute to the Titanium developer documentation available online at http://docs.appcelerator.</p>
