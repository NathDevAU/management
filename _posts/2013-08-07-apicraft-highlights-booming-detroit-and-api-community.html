<p>I’ve got a little secret to tell you about… last week I attended one of the best tech conferences I’ve ever attended, and it was in Detroit.API-Craft 2013 started with a simple goal – to gather together the leading minds of the API world in one place, and give them a chance to learn and collaborate on equal ground.Organized by the Detroit arm of the popular api-craft mailing list, the conference was designed from the ground-up with that goal in mind, from the geeky, API-powered event website, to their deliberate decision to take no sponsorship offers, and their choice of the open and democratic “unconference” format.The results were nothing short of spectacular.No chest-puffing sponsor talks, no sales pitches, and no show floor full of corporate logos.</p>
