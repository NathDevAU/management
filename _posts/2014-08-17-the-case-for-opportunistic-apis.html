<p>One of the questions that I run into frequently is whether APIs should be designed to be reusable.What is important to realize is that reusability implies stability over a relatively long period of time.Such stability is usually appropriate if an API is to be used for partner integration or exposed externally as part of your business model.But what if the API is created simply to improve the collaboration between your mobile development team and the team maintaining a backend system of record?In an earlier blog, Developers want easily consumable APIs, I called out that to a developer: 
- Reuse is about speed to deliver  
- Sharing is about expediency 
- Encapsulation is about less to learn 
An API needs to be attractive to use â€“ and speed, not stability, is the critical factor.</p>
