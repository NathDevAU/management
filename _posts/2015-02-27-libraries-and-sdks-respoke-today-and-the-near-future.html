<p>Respoke is working hard to create the best tools to enable real time communications.We are continually adding new features and components to make the developer experience better.In this post I’ll talk a bit about the libraries and SDKs that allow you to connect to and use Respoke.I’ll explain some of the differences between our client and server libraries/SDKs and what you can do with each.I’d also like to share the vision we have for moving forward by describing what’s on our roadmap for the near future.</p>
