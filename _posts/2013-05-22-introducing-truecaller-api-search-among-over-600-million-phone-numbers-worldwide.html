<p>Users of Truecaller can share their contacts and in return get access to the collaborative database of names and numbers.It is this unique data that Truecaller now has made available via their API.A guest post by Truecaller, the world’s largest collaborative phone directory
 The Truecaller API, powered by 3scale, makes it easy to connect a name to a phone number.This has previously not been a trivial problem – pre-paid phones and carriers unwilling or unable to share data are just some of the problems.Truecaller has solved this problem by crowd-sourcing.</p>
