  abstract: A method to measure the performance of an Application Programming Interface
    (API) includes selecting a target API and tracking memory allocation for the functional
    calls of the selected API to generate a list of functions called by the API. The
    individual functions are then called within the API in isolation and timing and
    memory allocation data for each are collected and recorded. The recorded results

  summary: ""
  abstract: Certain example embodiments described herein relate to an application
    programming interface (API) management system and/or method that automatically
    detects API domains, e.g., by analyzing consumer registration and runtime data,
    while also allowing API providers to provide approval for proposed detected domains
    and/or continued governance. The technology set forth herein not only provides
    an automatic detection mechanism, but also provides the capability of full management/control,
    while also allowing API producers to dynamically expand or otherwise modify their
    API domain offerings based on usage, etc. This dynamic process can be fully or

  name: Managing API authorization
  summary: ""
  abstract: Multiple variants of an API can coexist through API management by using
    metadata in a pre-processing and post-processing system to weed out requests to
    which a client does not have permission and return parameters that do not belong
    with the API request variant. Metadata is added to request objects such that an
    instance of a request object may be examined to determine a request handler to
    properly inspect the request object and recommend further processing or rejection
    of the instance. Metadata may also be added to a response object created as a
    result of processing the request object such that a response handler may be identified
    to ensure the fields match the proper response to the request object. The API
    may be dynamically managed at the point of request and also at the point of return
    rather than a statically coded whitelist checked multiple times within the code
    itself.
